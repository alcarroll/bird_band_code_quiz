Bird banding uses standardized 4 and 6 legger codes for species documentation. This quiz tests a user's knowledge of the banding codes.

This is primarily a practice in Python as the banding codes generally follow the rules listed below and are not difficult to identify when presented with the full species name in text.

General banding code guidelines:

    If the name is one word, the code is the first four letters.

       DICK Dickcissel
       SORA Sora

    If the name is two unhyphenated words, the code is the first two letters of each word.

       MODO Mourning Dove
       AMRO American Robin

    If the name is three words, the code is the first letter of each of the first two words, and the first two letters of the third word. A name of three hyphenated words is treated the same way.

       GCFL Great Crested Flycatcher
       AWPE American White Pelican
       CWWI Chuck-will's-widow

    If the name is a word and a pair of hyphenated words, the code is the first two letters of the unhyphenated word and the first letter of each of the hyphenated words.

    Hyphenated word first (coded essentially the same as a three-word name):

       BTGR Boat-tailed Grackle
       RTHU Ruby-throated Hummingbird
       RTHA Red-tailed Hawk

    Hyphenated word last:

       EASO Eastern Screech-Owl
       EAWP Eastern Wood-Pewee

    There are a very few bird names where the first word contains two capital letters. Such words are treated like a hyphenated word:

       LCSP LeConte's Sparrow
       MGWA MacGillivray's Warbler

    If the name has four parts, either separate words or hyphenated parts, the code is the first letter of each part

       BCNH Black-crowned Night Heron
       NRWS Northern Rough-winged Swallow
       BBWD Black-bellied Whistling-Duck
